# twiliowhatsapp

This is a simple project to get you setup with Whatsapp BOT.
Since Whatsapp API is limited to Medium and Large Scale organizations, we would be using the sandbox provided by Twilio.
We will be hosting our webapp in Heroku.

This project is made in Python.

Before startig up, please make sure that you have Python installed in your machine, and its PATH added to your environment.

For Mac users, you would already have Python installed, which is an older version. Mac supports multiple versions of Python simultaneously.
Download the latest Python in your machine and configure the environment variables.

Check https://www.architectryan.com/2012/10/02/add-to-the-path-on-mac-os-x-mountain-lion/ for configuring environment variables in Mac.

You would also need an account with Twilio(VAS Provider). 

Since, we would need to host our app in the web, we would need a cloud platform. We will be using Heroku for this, as its quite easy to setup.
